Summary
=======

Pathetic is a simple viewer for RepRap [#reprap]_ GCode [#gcode]_ written in
python [#python]_, using numpy [#numpy]_ and pyglet [#pyglet]_. It is also an
opportunity for me to learn a bit OpenGL.


Ideas for Features
==================

This does neither mean that I will implement any of this nor that these are
good ideas. They are just ideas and I wanted to write them down somewhere

* 3D View
* Statistics (Layer statistics)
* Coloring assistant (visual selection of parts, output of filament length to fuse)
* Comparison Window (to compare Skeinforge [#skeinforge]_ and Slic3r [#slic3r]_ output)
* GCode Debug/Polish Mode (Graphical way to edit GCode, to remove unwanted
paths, infill, ...)
